## Apps

* [Byword (Mac and iOS)](http://bywordapp.com/)
* [Draft (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mvilla.draft&hl=en)
* [Use OSX (Windows)](http://www.watt-32.net/misc/bsod-joke.png)
* Any app that you put text in (everywhere you enter text)

Note:

Now, although a big part of the point is that you don't *need* special
software... some apps make markdown *even more* delightful.
