## Better communication is better!

* Less ambiguity
* Think about hierarchy
* WYSIWTF

Note:

I see that you made this blue in Word. Should I make that a link? Does
that mean it should be blue on the website? Do you not know how to
make it not blue?

Sprinkling styles as your muse leads you in Word makes for bad
information architecture.

WYSIWYG interfaces are only loosely related to what the user will see.
Let's stop lying to ourselves.

Formatting prematurely is a distraction.
