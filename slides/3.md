## The least you need to know

* `#` is the biggest heading
* `##` is a heading one degree smaller than above
* `[link](url)`
* `*` at the beginning of a line make lists
* `*`*This text is emphasized*`*` will be emphasized (commonly italic)
* `**`**This text is strongly emphasizes**`**` (commonly bold)

Note:

If you've received an email from me, you've likely seen markdown.

One pound sign is hte biggest heading and as you want to diminish your
headings you add pound signs. You'll likely not go past 3 very often.

Text in bracket is what would be displayed, the url goes in a
parenthesis
