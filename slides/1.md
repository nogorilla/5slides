## Why would I want that!?

* It works everywhere
* It is guaranteed to work for a very long time

I'm perfectly happy with Word, why would I want that?

Have you done that thing, where you format something, then you do a little

Like trying to flick a formatting booger off your text.

It's because all of the formatting starts and stops are hidden from you,
so you have to guess how to turn them off.
