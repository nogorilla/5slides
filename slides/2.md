## Myths

* It's a Mac thing
* It's for developers
* It's too complicated

Note:

Markdown was created by a writer to make his life easier. WYSIWYG is a
lie.

There are 2 aspects of html that add friction to newcomers. One, they
aren't used to thinking about information architecture and they pick
font styles and sizes at whim in Word's pallet. Two, the syntax is
kind of unwieldy.

Markdown addresses both of them. I know html. I grok it. I don't like
writing it all that much. I write my own blog posts and such in markdown
and convert to html when possible.

I also write things that will never become html in markdown. emails,
instant messages, todo lists... whatever.

There are less amazing markdown apps on windows because there are less
amazing apps ons windows.
